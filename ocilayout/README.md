# ocilayout

Package `ocilayout` provides an `oci.Registry` implementation backed by an
[OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md)
directory on disk.

Use it when you want registry-like reads and writes without running a registry
server. It stores manifests in `index.json`, blobs under `blobs/`, and records
named references with the standard `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name`
annotation.

The experimental `oci.TagHistory` capability stores assignment and deletion
events in a custom top-level `index.json` annotation. This keeps current tags
and their history in one atomic index update, and history survives reopening or
deleting the tag. Other OCI layout tools can ignore the annotation, but tools
that rewrite or strip it will lose the history. Because the full event log is
embedded in the annotation, `index.json` grows as tags change; this is a
prototype storage format, not a scalable long-term history store.

## Shared Layout

`New` opens a single OCI layout directory that can hold multiple repositories.
Missing layout files are not created when the registry is opened; write
operations create `oci-layout`, `index.json`, and blob directories lazily.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ohseeeye/oci"
	"github.com/ohseeeye/oci/ocilayout"
)

func main() {
	reg, err := ocilayout.New("./layout", &ocilayout.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	tags, err := oci.All(reg.Tags(context.Background(), "example/app", nil))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(tags)
}
```

When reading existing layouts that use tag-only `ref.name` annotations, set
`DefaultRepo` so those entries can be associated with a repository.

```go
reg, err := ocilayout.New("./layout", &ocilayout.Options{
	DefaultRepo: "example/app",
})
```

## Per-Repository Layouts

`NewPerRepository` stores each repository in its own nested OCI layout under the
given directory. For repository `example/app`, the underlying layout lives at
`<dir>/example/app`.

```go
reg, err := ocilayout.NewPerRepository("./layouts", &ocilayout.PerRepoOptions{})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

The per-repository constructor has its own options type so its API can evolve
independently from `New`.

## Finding Layouts From Paths

`FindLayout` splits a user-supplied path into the base directory for `New` and
the image reference suffix. It first looks for `oci-layout` marker files in path
prefixes and uses the deepest matching layout. If no marker exists, it falls
back to treating the last path component as the reference.

```go
baseDir, ref, err := ocilayout.FindLayout("./foo/bar:baz")
// baseDir == "./foo"
// ref.Repository == "bar"
// ref.Tag == "baz"
```

```go
baseDir, ref, err := ocilayout.FindLayout("./one/two/three/four:tag")
// If ./one/two/oci-layout exists:
// baseDir == "./one/two"
// ref.Repository == "three/four"
// ref.Tag == "tag"
```

References may include tags, digests, or both:

```go
baseDir, ref, err := ocilayout.FindLayout("./layout/repo:tag@sha256:...")
```

## Sparse manifests

Set `Options.AllowSparseManifests` (or `PerRepoOptions.AllowSparseManifests`)
to accept manifests before their child manifests or blobs arrive. It defaults to
false. Manifest structure and descriptors are still validated, and absent child
content returns not found until uploaded. This is useful for read-through caches.

Sparse mode also permits independent eviction of referenced children. Deletion
records repository-scoped markers in the custom top-level index annotation
`io.github.ohseeeye.oci.evicted.v1`; pushing or mounting content restores it.
Physical files are retained for existing readers and other repositories, so
logical eviction does not reclaim disk space. Tools that strip the annotation
lose these deletion markers. Garbage collection remains separate.
